## Introduction

This program is designed to simulate and visualize cellular automata. Cellular automata are computational models that exhibit dynamic behavior emerging from the local interaction of cells arranged in a regular lattice. This README provides general information about the program and instructions for usage.

## Features

The *anks-ca* program offers the following features:

* **Cellular Automata Simulations**: The program allows you to simulate various types of cellular automata, each governed by different rules and behaviors.

* **Visualization**: The program provides a graphical interface to visualize the cellular automata simulations in real-time.

* **Rule Customization**: You can customize the rules and parameters of the cellular automata simulations to explore different patterns and behaviors.

## Installation

To use the `anks-ca`, follow these steps:

1. **Download**: Download and install [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) library.
2. **Update**: Since the project is based on `ps-sdl-wrapper` submodule, you need to update it by navigating to the directory containig the submodule and run the following command: `git submodule update --remote`

## Usage

Once the `anks-cs` is installed, you can use it to display and simulate different rules of cellular automata. Here are the general steps to use the program:

1. **Configure**: Set up the initial state, rules, and parameters of the cellular automata simulation. This may involve specifying the lattice structure, neighborhood type, and the specific rule to be applied.

2. **Run**: Start the simulation to observe the evolution of the cellular automata over time. The program will update the visualization in real-time.

3. **Interact**: Depending on the program's capabilities, you may be able to interact with the simulation during runtime. This could include pausing, resetting, or modifying the simulation parameters.

4. **Analyze**: Analyze the patterns and behaviors that emerge from the cellular automata simulation. Observe how changes in the initial state or rules affect the overall dynamics.

## Examples

To help you get started, here are a few examples of cellular automata simulations you can try with the *anks-ca* program:

1. **Rule 30**: Explore Rule 30, a one-dimensional cellular automaton that exhibits complex and chaotic behavior.

## Conclusion

The *anks-ca* provides a platform for displaying and simulating different rules of cellular automata. By exploring various initial states and rules, you can observe the emergence of complex patterns and behaviors. Use this *README* as a guide to install, use, and experiment with the program. Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of cellular automata!
